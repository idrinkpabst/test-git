GitHub Flavored Markdown
================================

*View the [source of this content](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html).*

Let's get the half "linebreak" thing out of the way. The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:

Roses are red
Violets are orange

The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two HUGE spaces and a newline character:

Roses are ready  
Violets are orange

Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the crinkling of words with multiple underscores in them like perform_complicated_task or do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.

A bit of the GitHub spicey

In addition to the changes in the previous section, certain references are auto-linked:

* SHA: be6a8cc
* User@SHA ref: mojombo@be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2
* User/Project@SHA: mojombo/god@be6a8cc1c1e
* \#Num: #1
* User/#Num: mojombo#1
* User/Project#Num: mojombo/god#1

These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:

My email addy is jake@github.com.
